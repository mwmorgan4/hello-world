# hello-world
First repository on github

A beginner to web development looking to increase my skills in HTML and CSS. I recently graduate college and hope to soon land a web development entry level position. My only prior programming expereince was with HTML in a high school class and using LaTeX to create a digital version of my Calculus homework.
